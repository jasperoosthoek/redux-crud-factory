##### Version 0.0.18
- Split `reducerFactory` and move `mapToProps` function to `mappersFactory`
- Cleaning up state: prevent actions from other reducers to create initial state or garbage in state

##### Version 0.0.19
- Custom Axios request config `axiosConfig` can be added when calling any action (e.g. `createFoo(obj, { axiosConfig: { timeout: 2000 } })` ): https://axios-http.com/docs/req_config
- The `config.actions` object has default { method: ..., route: ..., prepare: ... } for each action.
- Each action has a configurable route string or function, prepare function and axios method
- actionDispatchers have stripped (create, getList etc.) as well as full function names (createFoo, getFooList etc.)
- **Breaking change**: includeActions only allows extra arguments to be passed in `args` key: `extraAction(obj, { args: { extra: 'argument' }})`.

##### Version 0.1.0
- **Breaking change**: Multiple configurations are combined to a single configuration
- Callbacks object with dispatchable action functions of all configurations as second argument

##### Version 0.1.1
- **Breaking change**: Call with reduxCrudFactory({ config: ... }) instead of reduxCrudFactory( ... ) to allow for more fields
- Add default config fields: reduxCrudFactory({ config, axios, id, onError, actions, connect }) that are merged with factory config
- Correctly handle update action when object key (byKey !== id) changes or when parent key changes.
- Fix not mapping objects to props when id !== byKey
- Always give 2 arguments to callback instead of 3 (combine second and third argument)
- All callbacks now get async redux actions as well allowing a callback or onResponse to trigger another api call.

##### Version 0.1.2
- Each action function now has a `callback` and `onError` function
- Make `onResponse` function for custom actions optional

##### Version 0.1.3
- Fix: getList actions not triggering getListIsLoading redux action

##### Version 0.1.4
- **Breaking change**: Default/initial list object in state is now `null` instead of `{}` to differentiate between *not ready* and *no data* respectively

##### Version 0.1.5
- Fix: Delete action in reducer messes up state

##### Version 0.1.6
- Give first argument of `includeAction` as `obj` argument to `onResponse` function

##### Version 0.1.7
- Reset selected value for single selection when setting list when it is selected in the previous state but it no longer exists in the new state

##### Version 0.1.8
- Fix setting object getAll reducer when list === null in initial state 

##### Version 0.1.9
- Initial `list` object is now `null` instead of empty object when `parent` is defined

##### Version 0.2.0
- Include `hooks` and `hooksStripped` object which perform the same as redux `connect`
- Combine `mapToProps` and `mapToPropsStripped` to a single function because it is more DRY

##### Version 0.2.1
- Turn off `select` in default config and turn on `getAll` action when parent is set
- New `parseIdToInt` and `parseParentToInt` option to allow for string to be used as integer id
- Test for allowed props in hooks

##### Version 0.2.2
- Refactor hooks so dispatchable action functions have `isLoading` and `error` key

##### Version 0.2.3
- Greatly improve `actions` and `hooks`
- Fix not adding `includeActions` to `actionDispatchers`
- New `set` and `clear` functions for `includeProps`
- `select === 'multiple'` now works

##### Version 0.2.4
- Rename `includeProps` setting to `includeState`
- Use `shallowEqual` in `useSelector` when reusing `mapToProps`
- Fix: Not giving `list` as prop when `getList` action is false and `getAll` action is true and parent prop is given to the mapToProps/hooks
- Synchronous redux action after `delete` is now called `clear`
- Make `clear` action available so items can be easily removed in the state

##### Version 0.2.5
- New `prepareResponse()` function to prepare the result from the api for instance for pagination
- All actions return data as well when using async/await
- Make set/clear redux actions generated by includeState unique for each object
- Fix bug in created setFoo/clearFoo functions

##### Version 0.2.6
- Hooks return single object when supplied with id as argument instead of only { id }

##### Version 0.3.0
- Refactor state, all loading and error state in separate `actions` object
- Rename `config.includeState` to `config.state`
- Manage `config.state` in separate `state` object
- Refactor `actionTypes` from plain object to nested object with sub types
- Simplify `reducerFactory` by handling all `isLoading`, `error` and `clearError` action sub types at once
- Add `args`, `params`, `route` and `method` to loading state of dispatchable function

##### Version 0.3.1
- Fix bug in handling `hooks` and map functions when parent is defined
- All async methods from hooks, like `getFoo()`, now also have `getFoo.clearError()` property function that is aware of parent state
- Fix hooks not supplying `undefined` state setters functions
- Remove unneeded properties from result of hooks, i.e. `getFooIsLoading`
- All async actions return silently when `isLoading` is true to prevent them from running twice
- Rename `obj` property to `data`
- Fix `config.parseParentToInt` property not working properly

##### Version 0.3.2
- Fix `mapToProps` not working correctly when returning parent state

##### Upcoming
- Return `...ClearError` functions in `onResponse` function
- Make isLoading etc specific when id is given to the hook
- Merge `includeActions` with `actions`
- Move `config.actions.select` to `config.select`
- Allow for parent state when `parent` is defined
